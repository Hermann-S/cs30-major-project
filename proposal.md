# Ingredients 
- 1 ½ pounds boneless chicken breast or tenderloin
- ½ cup flour all purpose
- 2 large eggs beaten
- 1 ½ Cup breadcrumbs or panko, seasoned
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon salt, kosher
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 cup Vegetable oil

# INSTRUCTIONS
 
- Place chicken in a bag or under plastic wrap and lightly 
- pound with a mallet to an even thickness. Cut chicken into desired size.
- Create a breading station by placing each flour, breadcrumbs
- and egg mixture in shallow bowls. Season the breadcrumbs with salt, garlic powder and pepper.
- Dip each piece of chicken first in flour, then egg and 
- then crumbs to completely coat.
- Heat oil in a frying pan over medium high heat. Once oil 
- comes up to 350°F start frying chicken in batches, being sure not to overcrowd the pan.
- Cook 2-3 minutes per side. Check internal temperature with 
- a quick-read thermometer and make sure chicken is cooked to 165°F.
- Using tongs or a slotted spoon, remove cooked nuggets from
- oil and place on a paper towel lined plate and sprinkle a
- little salt over them if desired. Repeat with remaining chicken.
- Add more oil if needed in between batches.
- Serve warm and enjoy!
